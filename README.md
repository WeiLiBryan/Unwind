# Unwind
Unwind offers the user an all-in-one book, weather, and location search to help them plan an unplugged day of leisure. With our technology we encourage people to slow down, put down their phones, and enjoy a day of reading outside or in a local coffee shop to reconnect with the small joys that make us human. To help the user along the way, we offer location information on local libraries where they can find their book and give present them with either park of coffee shop option depending on the weather.

## Goals and Methods
The goal of our app is to use several APIs that help the user to put together an experience catered to their interests, location, and local weather conditions. In the design process we layed out the physical layout of the app but also focused on creating a greater narrative to help guide the user experience. We identified a "problem"- the stress of being constantly connected and robotic"- and then offered a solution- be a human and go read a book somewhere.
